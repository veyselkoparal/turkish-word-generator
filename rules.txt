1. Letters n and b, cannot stand next to each other in form of 'nb' that part 
of any word must automatically turned into 'mb' instead.

(see: pembe)
(see: bomba)

2. Words cannot start with the letter Äž.

3. Turkish words must have vowel harmony

(see: televizyon) This word is not Turkish (french origin) and we can 
understand it from vowel harmony.
After the 'e' (or 'i', which also breaks the rule) voice, the 'o' voice 
arrives in a sequence. That is not a valid case in Turkish words.
